      "text": "Fantastic sound and fit! I got these during the special Prime sale for $15. I thought for $15 I’d try them…not really needing them or so I thought. I listen in bed a lot with a pair of bone conduction earphones. It does the trick for simple listening to reviews of items and stuff like that but the sound quality is meh. So here are my first impressions. Packaging - this comes in a small box that keeps the earbuds secure and is very easy to open. Once opened you are greeted by very simple instructions that guide you to your Alexa app. Setup - once in the app, it recognizes the earbuds instantly and asks if you want to set them up. I pressed yes and was set up in no time. App - it says that you need an app so I pressed to get that. I was taken to the App Store where I didn’t see an echo buds app but instead the Alexa app that I already had. So I’m not sure if it simply updated the app or what. But it did everything quickly and I was onto the next step. The app is simple to use and lets you adjust the bass, mids and treble - which I instantly used to set it to my preference. I do not like not having an eq for headphones so this was a pleasant surprise. I do wish there were a way to save custom presets so I could quickly change the settings for let’s say pop to classical music. Use - I quickly downloaded Sirius XM and was off to listening to favorite stations in no time ranging from Christian worship to The Beach Boys to Rachmaninoff. The sound was crystal clear and very pleasing. I’m an audio engineering professor and will actually incorporate these into my mixing repertoire as I have the ability to use Bluetooth headphones directly with Pro Tools. These will be perfect to check final mixes on what consumers listen to most now - ear buds. I will toggle between the professional headphones I use and these - which I think will inform my mixing decisions more. Fit - they just fit…this is the first pair of earbuds that I didn’t have to do any Messi by s around with/ just put them on and enjoy…no falling out and they are very comfortable. After wearing them for a few minutes you forget they are on. They can be worn for a long time because of how comfortable they are. Build quality - in addition to seeing professional packaging, it was great to see when I opened it how beautiful the case was. It is sleek and comfortable to hold. Opening the case you are greeted with two stylish earbuds - mine were the black variety. The actual earbuds are very nice looking with a shiny understated black and nice clear silicon that is the many part which grabs the ear Recommendation - I highly recommend these for someone wanting a quality pair of earbuds buds in a decent price range. Even at the full $50 price they are wonderful. I would suspect they compete with earbuds that are more in the $100 range. I will likely compare them to my wife’s AirPods to check differences. I’ve had other EarPods in this price range and I can say these are definitely worlds above. I haven’t even gotten into the phone calling abilities…that next for me to try. But I suspect they will be great for that. They get wonderful reviews from major publishers like PC world. God bless and enjoy your new immersive earbuds!",

      "text": "I got these when they first came out and I've had them for about a month now. These are the first wireless earbuds I've ever purchased so I didn't know what to expect but so far I'm pleasantly surprised, especially considering how inexpensive they are. I think the sound is great. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but I can definitely tell that these have much better sound quality than my wired earbuds. My only complaint from a sound standpoint is occasionally there will be interference or it will cut out. I assume this is just par for the course for something that's wireless / bluetooth, but it can be annoying and there have been a couple of times I needed to reconnect them to clear up an audio problem. It doesn't happen enough for it to be a deal breaker though, and it could just be my phone as it never happens with computer audio. As far as Alexa integration, these work great. I barely have to say \"Alexa\" above a whisper for the earbuds to activate, which is great when I'm in public and don't want to appear like I'm talking to myself. It also helps if I don't want to trigger one of my nearby Alexa devices, although even if I do, the proximity awareness of echo devices means that if I have my earbuds in, my other echo's won't pick up the command, which is great. From a comfort standpoint, I think my opinion is going to be subjective, after all, everyone's ears are different. I can keep these earbuds in for up to two hours before I need a break. I don't like to keep the earbuds in when I'm not using them so I keep the case in my pocket and take the earbuds out when I'm not using them. That keep my ears from getting tired. I think the battery life is great. Again, I usually only keep them in my ears for around 2 hours, but there have been a couple of times that I've keep them in for 4 to 5 hours and they've almost run completely out of power. In those cases, 15 to 20 minutes in the case and they are good as new. In addition to all this, I really like the features of these earbuds. They were very easy to setup with the Alexa app. They seamlessly connect to my phone and laptop at the same time and I can listen to audio from either device at any time without having to do any type of manual switching. I can be listening to audio on my laptop and if my phone rings, it will pause whatever is playing on my laptop to give me an opportunity to answer the phone. The tapping gestures are programable and straightforward, and I have the ability to summon both Alexa and Google's Assistant at any time either by voice or by a long-press. All in all, these are great. I'd say 4.5 stars instead of five, but since I can't do half stars, I feel like these are so good that it's better to round up than down. You honestly can't beat these for the price.",

      "text": "I recently bought the Amazon Echo Buds (3rd Gen) and overall, I’m pretty happy with the sound quality and features. The sound is crisp and clear. However, there’s one thing that really bothers me—the fit. The buds themselves don’t seem to fit securely in my ears. Without the eartips, they don’t seal the ear canal, which affects both sound isolation and overall comfort. Even with the eartips in place, they still feel like they’re not quite the right fit for my ear shape. That said, the Amazon Alexa integration is seamless and works perfectly, and the battery life is solid—lasting through my daily commutes and workouts. If you have a good fit or don't mind occasionally adjusting them, these are great earbuds for the price, but if you have trouble with fit, it might not be the best choice for you.",

      "text": "Fantastic sound and fit! I got these during the special Prime sale for $15. I thought for $15 I’d try them…not really needing them or so I thought. I listen in bed a lot with a pair of bone conduction earphones. It does the trick for simple listening to reviews of items and stuff like that but the sound quality is meh. So here are my first impressions. Packaging - this comes in a small box that keeps the earbuds secure and is very easy to open. Once opened you are greeted by very simple instructions that guide you to your Alexa app. Setup - once in the app, it recognizes the earbuds instantly and asks if you want to set them up. I pressed yes and was set up in no time. App - it says that you need an app so I pressed to get that. I was taken to the App Store where I didn’t see an echo buds app but instead the Alexa app that I already had. So I’m not sure if it simply updated the app or what. But it did everything quickly and I was onto the next step. The app is simple to use and lets you adjust the bass, mids and treble - which I instantly used to set it to my preference. I do not like not having an eq for headphones so this was a pleasant surprise. I do wish there were a way to save custom presets so I could quickly change the settings for let’s say pop to classical music. Use - I quickly downloaded Sirius XM and was off to listening to favorite stations in no time ranging from Christian worship to The Beach Boys to Rachmaninoff. The sound was crystal clear and very pleasing. I’m an audio engineering professor and will actually incorporate these into my mixing repertoire as I have the ability to use Bluetooth headphones directly with Pro Tools. These will be perfect to check final mixes on what consumers listen to most now - ear buds. I will toggle between the professional headphones I use and these - which I think will inform my mixing decisions more. Fit - they just fit…this is the first pair of earbuds that I didn’t have to do any Messi by s around with/ just put them on and enjoy…no falling out and they are very comfortable. After wearing them for a few minutes you forget they are on. They can be worn for a long time because of how comfortable they are. Build quality - in addition to seeing professional packaging, it was great to see when I opened it how beautiful the case was. It is sleek and comfortable to hold. Opening the case you are greeted with two stylish earbuds - mine were the black variety. The actual earbuds are very nice looking with a shiny understated black and nice clear silicon that is the many part which grabs the ear Recommendation - I highly recommend these for someone wanting a quality pair of earbuds buds in a decent price range. Even at the full $50 price they are wonderful. I would suspect they compete with earbuds that are more in the $100 range. I will likely compare them to my wife’s AirPods to check differences. I’ve had other EarPods in this price range and I can say these are definitely worlds above. I haven’t even gotten into the phone calling abilities…that next for me to try. But I suspect they will be great for that. They get wonderful reviews from major publishers like PC world. God bless and enjoy your new immersive earbuds!",

      "text": "I got these when they first came out and I've had them for about a month now. These are the first wireless earbuds I've ever purchased so I didn't know what to expect but so far I'm pleasantly surprised, especially considering how inexpensive they are. I think the sound is great. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but I can definitely tell that these have much better sound quality than my wired earbuds. My only complaint from a sound standpoint is occasionally there will be interference or it will cut out. I assume this is just par for the course for something that's wireless / bluetooth, but it can be annoying and there have been a couple of times I needed to reconnect them to clear up an audio problem. It doesn't happen enough for it to be a deal breaker though, and it could just be my phone as it never happens with computer audio. As far as Alexa integration, these work great. I barely have to say \"Alexa\" above a whisper for the earbuds to activate, which is great when I'm in public and don't want to appear like I'm talking to myself. It also helps if I don't want to trigger one of my nearby Alexa devices, although even if I do, the proximity awareness of echo devices means that if I have my earbuds in, my other echo's won't pick up the command, which is great. From a comfort standpoint, I think my opinion is going to be subjective, after all, everyone's ears are different. I can keep these earbuds in for up to two hours before I need a break. I don't like to keep the earbuds in when I'm not using them so I keep the case in my pocket and take the earbuds out when I'm not using them. That keep my ears from getting tired. I think the battery life is great. Again, I usually only keep them in my ears for around 2 hours, but there have been a couple of times that I've keep them in for 4 to 5 hours and they've almost run completely out of power. In those cases, 15 to 20 minutes in the case and they are good as new. In addition to all this, I really like the features of these earbuds. They were very easy to setup with the Alexa app. They seamlessly connect to my phone and laptop at the same time and I can listen to audio from either device at any time without having to do any type of manual switching. I can be listening to audio on my laptop and if my phone rings, it will pause whatever is playing on my laptop to give me an opportunity to answer the phone. The tapping gestures are programable and straightforward, and I have the ability to summon both Alexa and Google's Assistant at any time either by voice or by a long-press. All in all, these are great. I'd say 4.5 stars instead of five, but since I can't do half stars, I feel like these are so good that it's better to round up than down. You honestly can't beat these for the price.",

      "text": "I recently bought the Amazon Echo Buds (3rd Gen) and overall, I’m pretty happy with the sound quality and features. The sound is crisp and clear. However, there’s one thing that really bothers me—the fit. The buds themselves don’t seem to fit securely in my ears. Without the eartips, they don’t seal the ear canal, which affects both sound isolation and overall comfort. Even with the eartips in place, they still feel like they’re not quite the right fit for my ear shape. That said, the Amazon Alexa integration is seamless and works perfectly, and the battery life is solid—lasting through my daily commutes and workouts. If you have a good fit or don't mind occasionally adjusting them, these are great earbuds for the price, but if you have trouble with fit, it might not be the best choice for you.",

Perfect for several days of use without needing to constantly recharge them. 💡 Additionally, the LED power display is a very useful detail, as it shows the charge level of each earbud and the case, something you don't usually find in models in this range. 🔇 As for sound quality, the headphones feature noise cancellation, allowing for an immersive audio experience even in noisy places.

Noise cancellation helps a lot to block out external noises and concentrate. I like that the case has an LED screen to know how much battery is left, which is very useful. And the best part: the battery lasts a long time. Between the hearing aids and the case, they offer up to 80 hours of use, so I almost forgot to charge them for days. They are comfortable, do not fall off easily and have good quality for the price. Definitely a great purchase if you're looking for reliable and durable headphones.",

The sound quality is clear with decent bass, and the noise canceling works well enough to block out most background noise while I’m at the gym or out running. The best part is the battery life — I easily get several days of use without needing to recharge, and the LED display on the case makes it super easy to check the battery level. Also love that they’re IPX7 waterproof, so I don’t have to worry about sweat or light rain. They fit comfortably and stay secure during workouts. The controls are responsive, and pairing with my phone was instant. Overall, great value for the price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for reliable sports earbuds!",

Perfect for several days of use without needing to constantly recharge them. 💡 Additionally, the LED power display is a very useful detail, as it shows the charge level of each earbud and the case, something you don't usually find in models in this range. 🔇 As for sound quality, the headphones feature noise cancellation, allowing for an immersive audio experience even in noisy places. The sound is clear, with good bass and excellent balance.

      "text": "When I say so far, I mean I only got it today so I haven't been able to test the longevity of the charge or its durability over time. But for this price, what I have experienced so far is impressive. It was charged fully in 2.5 hours. Probably before that but I didn't check. They are very light and comfortable over the ears. My ears are very sensitive to any kind of prolonged pressure and some headphones like airpods are just impossible for me to wear. Even ones I do consider bearable start to hurt after a short period of time. These felt almost like nothing. Despite their comfort, even without music playing they provided a quiet experience. I had the TV on and could barely hear it with the headphones on. It was very easy to pair (it took a few seconds but did so effortlessly) and the controls are fairly intuitive. The cord may come in handy in the future, so it was a nice bonus. I also liked the left/right labelling, as it does make a difference and it's usually indicated in the tiniest letters possible, if at all. This made it simple and straightforward to don. I found there is a definite difference in sound using the equalizer presets, though for my taste the Pop equalizer sounded the best for pretty much all genres of music, ranging from opera to punk and a lot of stuff in between. Sound quality was far better than I anticipated from a $20 headset, certainly on par with those I have spent a lot more money on. If you are looking for inexpensive and GOOD headphones that don't hurt your head and effectively block out noise without the label and price of \"noise-cancelling\" this is your huckleberry.",

      "text": "These headphones are really light weight and comfortable, with some nice quality of life features. The left and right sides are marked clearly on the outside and in much larger R/L's on the inside of each ear. The adjustable size parts of the headband have settings they settle into with markings on them so you can set it the same amount on each side. The distance of the bluetooth connection is pretty far, I walked out of my bedroom, down a short hallway into my kitchen and it was still playing with only occasional cutting out. There was a closet and a small bathroom between me and my paired computer. There is a noticeable delay in the sound when gaming when using it with bluetooth, but that's just how that works of course. Not an audiophile or pro gamer, works great for music and minecraft. They stay on snug even when I whip my head side to side with just a little movement in place, and aren't too tight. I have pretty sensitive skin and it doesn't feel uncomfortable after wearing for a couple hours, though I do feel the pressure on my ears a bit after taking them off. The sound isolation is good too, not active noise canceling but makes everything much quieter, and with music playing at pretty mild volume it can be difficult to make out what someone right in front of you is saying. I don't know what the different sound modes really do or when I personally would want to switch to them, so I just keep it set to classic. To turn them on hold the multi function button for a 2 seconds, then to turn them off hold the button for 4 seconds. From off you enter pairing mode by holding the button for 4 seconds, and after pairing it to my pc it connects when I turn on the headphones. The instructions gave the name of the headphones to find on the list when checking discoverable bluetooth devices on my computer. This came with an aux cord and a charging cable, usb-c to usb-a. the cords aren't super long but they work for charging and connecting to my speakers if I want to listen in wired mode. I would probably want to use a longer aux cable if I wasn't just using bluetooth, so it could connect to the desktop tower itself at the back to avoid the static from my speakers.",

Sound quality is great and they're pretty comfortable (although I definitely don't forget I'm wearing them like other reviewers have said).

      "text": "I can’t say enough good things about these Bluetooth headphones—they're everything I wanted and more! From the moment I unboxed them, I was obsessed. Battery Life: First off, the battery life is unreal. I swear, I charged them once and they lasted for days (like, actual DAYS). Whether I'm working out, commuting, or just binging podcasts, they never die on me. No more constant recharging or losing audio mid-song—just hours and hours of reliable playtime. Performance: The sound quality is super crisp and clear, with just the right amount of bass. Calls are crystal-clear too, and the Bluetooth connection is rock solid—no lag, no random dropouts. They also pair in seconds, which is a huge plus. Design & Colors: Okay, let’s talk about the colors—so cute! 😍 Whether you're into soft pastels, bold brights, or sleek neutrals, there's something for every vibe. I got the lavender pair and I get compliments every single time I wear them. They're stylish and comfortable, with a snug, lightweight fit that doesn’t hurt even after hours of wear. Overall: These headphones are the perfect mix of form, function, and flair. Long battery life? Check. Great sound? Check. Aesthetic that matches your personality? Double check. I’m already thinking about getting a second pair in a different color just because I love them that much.",

They are also super durable. I have a big head so I can't tell you how many times I have cracked headphone spreading them open to get them around my ears. I've had these for 5 months and that is the longest I've had a pair of headphone without that happening. They are also super comfortable. I wear them for hours at a time and never feel like I have to take them of because they are grating me or squeezing my head to hard. And finally, they don't easily slip off your head. If you shake your head hard enough, obviously they will fall off. But they won't fall if you do something as innocuous as bend forward (that has happened to me a lot with other pairs of headphones). Could not recommend these headphones more.",

      "text": "I've been using these headphones literally every day for more than a year, and they're still performing extremely well. They reliably and consistently connect to my devices. When I power these headphones up, I simply know that they're going to connect. Not so with my previous headphones that cost nearly as much. With my previous headphones (that did not have any noise cancellation feature), it was a roll of the dice every time I wanted to connect to my devices. Sometimes I would have to cycle them 2 or 3 times just to get them to connect. The build quality is excellent. Battery life is also very good...diminished somewhat if the noise cancelling feature is enabled. They're also comfortable to wear for hours on end. I would definitely buy these headphones again. They're a very good value. Although I rarely use it, the noise cancellation feature is robust, especially for mid-range frequencies. A characteristic of any noise-cancellation technology is a slight sensation of over-pressure, but it's not objectionable. It's most noticeable when the noise cancellation feature is first enabled, and again when it's switched off. I highly recommend these headphones for daily use.",

      "text": "Back in 2019 I purchased the TaoTronics SoundSurge 46 headphones and I love them. They're no longer for sale on Amazon and they Toatronics US won't send their headphones overseas, so I ordered a these ZIHNIC headphones as a possible replacement as the earpads have fallen off and disintergrated. I really like them. The sound is great, although a tad boomy but that can be a good thing depending on the music you like. My only complaint is that the Bluetooth range/distance is really poor and I dearly would love to find a pair as good as these or the taotronics that has the range the taotronics had. The ZIHNIC's start to lose the connection even at 5m sometimes and you'd be lucky to get 15m in a straight line before losing the connection completely. With the Taotronics I could be 100m line of sight and still have a great connection. Or be 20m away and behind two steel shed walls and still get a connection. They're tough and the noise cancelling is great but not quite as good as the Taotronics. Close enough though. So if anyone knows of a set of bluetooth (preferably 5.0+) headphones please recommended them. If you're sitting close to the bluetooth transmitter with the ZIHNIC's then they're ideal. Great for the price. And battery life is fantastic but I do tend to top them up at least every two days.",

Build quality seems pretty good for normal use- I don't blast music or abuse them. The noise cancelling is okay- only 'takes the edge off' loud noises but doesn't cancel them completely. But with that and music I can work from home and tune out the kids making noise. I would buy them again.",

This comes with a jack connector and cable, I am able to plug it in the entertainment system during flight. I had seats near the jet engine, kids .. and the noise canceling is perfect for those situations plus the audio is much better than any headsets handed out during flights",

I have used these multiple times now to take phone calls and the sound and mic quality is crystal clear. They were very easy to set up and use.

The charging case is where this set really shines. I love the digital display showing the battery percentage for each earbud—super useful and something you usually only see in higher-end models. The red LED lights are a nice touch too; they make it easy to know they’re charging at a glance. Battery life is decent—I’ve gotten several hours of playback per charge without any issues. Bluetooth connection is quick and stable. For the price, this is a solid buy. Perfect for casual listening, workouts, or just having a backup pair on hand. Overall: 5/5 stars.

Ich trage die Kopfhörer am Tag mehrere Stunden und habe bisher nie irgendwelche unangenehmen Druckgefühle. Sie sitzen beim Sport fest im Ohr und Außengeräusche sind so gut wie gar nicht wahrnehmbar, egal bei welcher Lautstärke. Es liegen drei Paar Stopfen aus Silikon in verschiedenen Größen bei. Der Sound ist sehr klar, die Bässe sind kräftig. Die Sensortechnik für die Steuerung ist einfach zu handhaben und sicher. Ich benutze die Kopfhörer regelmäßig beim Duschen und hatte bisher nie Probleme damit. Sobald die Kopfhörer aus dem Case entnommen werden, verbinden sie sich problemlos und schnell mit dem Smartphone und anderen Geräten. Die Reichweite ist erstaunlich hoch. Zeitweise liegt mein Smartphone im Erdgeschoss und ich befinde mich im ersten Stock. Über die Laufzeit kann ich nicht viel berichten. Ich schätze sie Pi mal Daumen auf ca. 6 Stunden. Meist benutze ich nur eine Kopfhörerseite und wechsle sie, wenn sie leer wird. Über Sprache wird in englischer Sprache u.a. mitgeteilt, wenn der Akku schwach ist. Die Ladezeit für die Kopfhörer oder das Case schätze ich auf ca. 30-45 Minuten. Es kommt sicherlich auch darauf an, welcher Ladeadapter benutzt wird. Es dauert länger, wenn gänzlich alles leer ist. Alles in allem bin ich begeistert vom Preis-Leistungsverhältnis und der Qualität. Hoher Tragekomfort, toller Sound, eine einfache Bedienung und eine stabile Verbindung. Sollten meine Kopfhörer irgendwann einmal den Geist aufgeben, werde ich mir dieses Produkt wieder zulegen.",

      "text": "I've been all over the place with trying to figure out what to use for listening to my music while at the gym. I've tried earbuds and the primary issue is being able to keep them in place while I'm doing various activities. Inevitably, they always....I mean always...come loose, lose their ideal placement for optimal sound and I need to re-establish them. Needless to say...I'm not dealing with that. I even bought a pair that was supposedly one of the best...never lost their seating, etc. Returned after one gym session. BTW...I'm not doing crazy gymnastic stuff...basic use of equipment, walking on treadmill, stairclimber and recumbent bike. I am just getting back to the gym and a few years ago used a 'cheapo' on ear headphone set that I essentially viewed as 'throw-away'. It worked fine and sure enough, the covering got to a point from sweating they were no longer functional. So...that's where I was kinda going w/my decision-making this time. Even though I toyed w/the idea of buying a better headphone set...good brand w/good reputation that also had the option of replacing the earpads. Then I found these headphones. I wanted something that would provide decent sound quality. Check....not as good as my 'good travel headphones' but definitely better than buds, and good enough for 1.5 hours of gym time. They were advertised as lightweight and comfortable....check. Barely notice they are on. Value for the money....check. Paid about $20 for these!! Bluetooth connection and charging time vs playback is excellent. This is absolutely all I need while doing my 'gym thing'. If I were to have one 'gripe', it's the wish of having noise cancellation feature. I thought that the ambient gym noise...regular hub-bub and their own music, would be negated by the earpads and music. Yes, for the most part it does negate it, but would be a heckuva lot better to not have music quite so high for my hearing....yes...getting a tad older and that's becoming a greater concern. Otherwise, if you're thinking about these headphones, no need to debate....I wouldn't hesitate.",

      "text": "I use these at work, around the house, and with my PlayStation. They have fantastic quality and the ANC is very effective. My main reason for purchasing was ANC for in the office. I work two days a week in an open office setting which can lead to some very frustrating distractions. I looked at a few other brands and landed on these ones because of the price tag. Since my team is based all over the country, I do spend a lot of time on Teams calls. Here's a few observations: - I feel like there's some noticeable lag time when I'm connected via Bluetooth. It's not bad or even disruptive, you just notice it and gotta get used to it. - Connecting to two devices at once is HUGE. I frequently start a Teams meeting on my laptop and transfer it to my phone, not needing to disconnect bluetooth on one device and then on another is so nice. - Sound quality is great. I have not heard anyone complain about my mic/audio quality. - Very comfortable, but they are also hot. It's like wearing a winter puffer jacket suctioned to your ears. - I get a full work day of use out of them. They charge quickly, I can usually get them back to a high battery life during my drive home.",

It works perfectly fine. The battery life is incredible. It’s well worth it. I got on sale I believe for $79.99. The ear protection is perfect for people with glasses and the earbuds are super comfortable. As soon as I boot it up on the fresh opening, it connects quite easily. Overall I would give this a 10/10. Kudos to you Soundcore! Please keep making great products for people like me and millions of others! Thank you for taking the time to read my review. P. S.

I have been using it for a few months, both at home and during my university trips. I must say that the noise cancelling is at a satisfactory standard, as on trains, you won't hear the constant rumbling of train tracks and the numerous conversations around you. It becomes better if you play music with that mode on. The most notable feature is that Soundcore has an app in which you can connect your headphones, and it has numerous features. Personal EQ settings, theme settings, and hearing adjustment (if your old). The music quality is great overall, but I have noticed that it gets a bit rough if you go above maybe 80% volume, as the clarity goes down. Multi-point is a good bonus if you like to switch between devices consistently, it is a convenient feature for me as I often switch between my laptop and phone.",
