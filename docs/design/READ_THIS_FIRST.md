# Design Documentation

This directory will contain the core design documents for the amazon_tool project.

## TODO: Add these design documents

The following design files need to be added to complete the project specification:

- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and component design
- [ ] `API_DESIGN.md` - FastAPI endpoint specifications and data models  
- [ ] `DATABASE_DESIGN.md` - Supabase schema design and data relationships

## Next Steps

1. Add the three design documents above
2. Set up GitHub remote repository
3. Add dependency manifests (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
4. Implement core application code based on the design specifications
